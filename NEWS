mydns version 1.1.0 is an SQL-based DNS server.

This release is dated January 18, 2006.

Changes in version 1.1.0:

  * Implemented RFC 2136 (DNS UPDATE).  See the manual
    for usage instructions.
  * Fixed minor bug in admin.php where if db_get_settings()
    failed, it might display an error message without
    consistent formatting.
  * Added two additional fields to the --verbose query log.
    The opcode of the query (QUERY or UPDATE), and a quoted
    field containing a description of the UPDATE performed,
    if the opcode was UPDATE.
  * Updated contrib/stats.php to handle new log fields.
  * Fixed bug in --dump-config -- if present, fields without
    default values ("no-listen", "soa-where", "rr-where",
    and "recursive") were not being dumped.
  * Made --dump-config dump ALL possible configuration
    options, even if no value was originally specified.  As
    such, MyDNS will no longer warn the user when a config
    option doesn't have a value.  It will be silently ignored.
  * Including <inttypes.h> after a suggestion by Christian
    Tschenett, to help things out on 64-bit platforms like OSX.
    If this creates problems on your platform, please let me
    know.
  * Modified admin.php to allow a backslash in the 'mbox' field,
    immediately preceding a dot.  This is used in DNS to
    indicate the presence of a dot in the username part of the
    administrator's email address.  There was an additional bug
    report from Andreas Grip that MyDNS was replying with the
    slashes doubled up in this case, but it appears to be a
    problem with the "dig" program, not MyDNS.
  * Fixed bug with "rr-where" clause -- conf.c was using
    "soa-where" instead.  David Darville first reported this bug.
    Michael Gile submitted it two minutes later, with a patch.
  * Added "create_domain.pl" to the contrib/ directory.  Thanks
    to Gerard de Brieder for this script.  See contrib/README
    for more information.
  * Fixed bug in src/lib/rr.c (mydns_rr_load) that caused a
    segfault if origin was NULL (it was designed to allow NULL,
    but this version is the first to ever call it in that way).
  * Added support for NAPTR (RFC 2915) records.  Users with
    existing MyDNS databases will need to alter their tables to
    allow "NAPTR" in the "type" column if they want to use NAPTR.
  * Renamed library functions mydns_parse_rr() and mydns_parse_soa()
    to mydns_rr_parse() and mydns_soa_parse(), for consistency.
  * Library functions mydns_rr_dup() and mydns_soa_dup() now fail
    (terminating the program) if out of memory.
  * Moved routines that parse data for individual RR types (RP,
    SRV, and NAPTR) into individual functions from mydns_rr_parse
    for clarity.
  * Fixed bug where AXFR might transmit incorrect information if
    a FQDN is used in the 'name' field.
  * Fixed AXFR bug with ALIAS enabled.  Thanks to Sven Wegener for
    the patch.
  * Created file "README.mysql" to address various problems common
    while compiling with MySQL support.
  * Fixed "use of cast expressions as lvalues is deprecated"
    warning (caused compilation abort with --enable-debug).
  * Added hostname to beginning of SIGUSR1 status output.
  * Renamed "update" column in the soa table to "update_acl"; how
    could I be so stupid as to name a column "update"?!
  * Fixed a critical denial-of-service vulnerability.
